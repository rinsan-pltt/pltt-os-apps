"""ffmpeg-based clip concatenation for the Long Video (story) flow.

The per-scene clips usually come from one model with identical params, but a
provider fallback (e.g. one scene served by Runware at a slightly different
size) can change a stream mid-list — so every input is normalized through a
scale/pad + fps graph before the concat instead of stream-copied. Audio is
concatenated when every clip has an audio stream; a clip without one fails the
audio graph, and the merge retries video-only.

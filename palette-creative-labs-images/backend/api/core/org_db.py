"""Row-level-security context for the plugin's request DB session.

Every plugin table is created with Palette's org-isolation policy:

    USING      (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true)::bigint)
    WITH CHECK (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true)::bigint)

When that session variable is missing, `current_setting(..., true)` returns
NULL, the comparison is NULL, and Postgres treats the policy as failed. Reads
then return zero rows *silently* and writes blow up with

    InsufficientPrivilegeError: new row violates row-level security policy
    for table "pltt_creative__projects"

The platform applies the variable to the connection backing `ctx.db` at the
start of a request, but that guarantee does not survive this plugin's usage
pattern: the CRUD helpers in `db_helpers.py` `commit()` after almost every
write, and a committed SQLAlchemy session releases its connection back to the
pool. The next statement checks out a *different* pooled connection, which
never had the variable set — so anything after the first commit in a request
(and anything after a commit the platform itself made before handing the
session over) runs with no org context at all. A connection pooler in front of
Postgres (PgBouncer in transaction mode) breaks a session-level setting the
same way.

The fix is to (re)apply the variable per transaction instead of per request:
`after_begin` fires every time the session starts a transaction on a
connection, whichever pooled connection that turns out to be. It is applied
with `is_local => true`, so it is scoped to that transaction and can never
leak onto a pooled connection that another organisation picks up later.
